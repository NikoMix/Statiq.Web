# 1.0.0-beta.45

- **Breaking change:** To make the distinction between normal beginning of file block comments in a C# file and front matter comments, front matter block comments in C# files must now use an extra dash like `/*-` and `-*/`.
- Added support for more types of front matter delimiters in more places. For example, Razor files can now define front matter using Razor block comment syntax and a dash like `@*-` and `-*@` at the beginning of a file. HTML files can now define front matter using `<!---` and `--->` at the beginning of a file (notice three or more `-` characters instead of two). The various front matter delimiters are also universal and can be used in any file (I.e. you can new use C-style front matter block comments in `.css` files).
- Added `FrontMatterRegexes` and `AdditionalFrontMatterRegexes` settings to help customize the regular expressions used to find front matter.
- Expanded xref lookup behavior to look in all relevant pipelines, not just the "content" pipeline (exclusions can be customized using the `XrefPipelines` and `AdditionalXrefPipelines` settings).

- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.24](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.24).
- **Breaking change:** Removed the `ValidateAbsoluteLinks`, `ValidateRelativeLinks`, and `ValidateLinksAsError` settings in favor of the new analyzers.
  For example, to turn on absolute link validation with an error log level, set `Analyzers: ValidateAbsoluteLinks=Error` in your configuration file (or bootstrapper, etc.)
- Added new `ValidateAbsoluteLinks` and `ValidateRelativeLinks` analyzers (replaces the `ValidateLinks` pipeline).
- Removed the `ValidateLinks` pipeline.
- Added a new `AnalyzeContent` pipeline.
- Added base `HtmlAnalyzer` and `SyncHtmlAnalyzer` classes for analyzing HTML content.
- Added `Bootstrapper.AnalyzeHtml()` extensions for defining delegate-based HTML analyzers.
- Made the `PreviewCommand` and `ServeCommand` in Statiq.Web.Hosting public so you can call `IBootstrapper.AddCommand<PreviewCommand>()` directly without Statiq.Web.

# 1.0.0-beta.7

# 1.0.0-beta.5

# 1.0.0-beta.4

- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.21](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.21).
- **Breaking change:** Removed the `IBootstrapper.SetDefaultTemplate()` extension given more general use of templates. The "default" template should now be specified
  by setting a templates for the HTML media type (by default it's still Razor, so this breaking change won't really affect anyone right now).
- **Breaking Change:** Removed the `AssetFiles`, `DataFiles`, and `ContentFiles` settings and replaced with a single `InputFiles` setting for finding all input files.
  The target pipeline and content type are now determined from the media type and metadata of the document instead of via globbing patterns for each pipeline.
  If you previously had asset files that started with an underscore (such as a `_redirects` file), you will need to explicitly add those to the `InputFiles` patterns
  along with the default pattern: `.AddSetting(WebKeys.InputFiles, new [] { "**/{!_,}*", "_redirects" })`.
- Added a `ClearDataContent` document setting that clears content from data documents (for example, to support passing the data file to layouts).
  Set this for a single data document to clear it's content or globally with `.AddSetting(WebKeys.ClearDataContent, true)` to clear the content of all data files.
- Made the concept of "templates" more general. They now essentially use the media type of a document (typically inferred from file extension) to determine which pipeline to
  process the document in and what module to use for processing. Templates can now be defined for assets, data, and content and for the `Process` and `PostProcess` phases for each.
- Added a `ContentType` document setting to override the calculated pipeline and processing for a document (values are `Asset`, `Data`, and `Content`).
  For example, setting the `ContentType` of a file named "foo.json" to `Asset` will treat the file as an asset and will not process it's content as data.
- Added a `MediaType` document setting to override the media type calculated from the file extension.
- Added a `RemoveScriptExtension` document setting that will convert script file names like "foo.json.csx" to "foo.json" and reset their media types so the script output can be seamlessly
  processed by the appropriate pipeline and modules (for example, "foo.json.csx" will get processed by the `Data` pipeline while "foo.md.csx" will get processed by the `Content` pipeline).
  The default value is `true`.
- Removed the `Isolated` flag from the `Assets` pipeline so the set of copied assets can be retrieved from other pipelines (I.e. to generate a list of images in a directory).
- Added support for script files (`.csx` or `.cs`) to the `Archive` pipeline (I.e. to generate JSON APIs from a collection of documents or data).
- Added a `Script` document setting that will treat a file as a C# script, even if the extension is not `.cs` or `.csx`.
- Added a common `Inputs` pipeline that consolidates directory metadata, sidecar, and front matter parsing and supports evaluating scripts with a `.csx` or `.cs` extension.
  Detailed script usage will be documented on the site, but generally if the script returns null the original input document is returned, if the script returns a string the content
  of the document will be changed to the return value, or if the script returns a document(s) those will be added to the appropriate pipeline.
- New `Statiq.Web.Templates` project with a Statiq Web templates for the `dotnet new` CLI command (#915, thanks @devlead).

# 1.0.0-beta.3

- **Breaking change:** Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.20](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.20).
  This version of Statiq Framework contains breaking changes which Statiq Web will inherit.
- The `Content` pipeline no longer creates any metadata-based tree structure (I.e. the metadata key `Children` is no longer set). Instead, consider
  using methods from `Outputs` such as `Outputs.GetChildren(doc)` or the new `OutputPages` property (see the Statiq Framework 1.0.0-beta.20 release notes for more details).
- Added a new `MinimumStatiqWebVersion` key to perform a check for the minimum allowed version of Statiq Web. If this is set to something higher than the current version
  of Statiq Web, an error will be logged and execution will stop. Any setting that starts will this key will be considered, so it's recommended the use of this key be
  suffixed with a unique identifier to avoid conflicts between components (for example `MinimumStatiqWebVersion-MySite`). While not required or typically necessary for sites,
  it's recommended that themes set this in their theme settings file (for example `MinimumStatiqWebVersion-CleanBlog`).

# 1.0.0-beta.2

- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.19](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.19).

  This version of Statiq Framework contains breaking changes which Statiq Web will inherit.
- **Breaking change:** The `Content` pipeline no longer nests output documents and instead all documents are now output.
  `IEnumerable<IDocument>.FilterDestinations("*.html")` or `Outputs["*.html"]` can be used to get "root" documents.
- Added a `MakeLinksAbsolute` setting to rewrite relative links to be absolute.
- Added a `MakeLinksRootRelative` setting to rewrite relative links to be root-relative.
- Suppressed archive output when there's no documents to archive.
- Added the `CacheDocuments` module to additional pipelines for faster rebuild times.

- Added a `PublishedUsesLastModifiedDate` setting to control whether a file modified date should be used for getting published dates.
- Added `settings` as a default settings file name in themes (with support for JSON, YAML, or XML formats).
- Added support for sidecar files in other input directories at the same relative path (I.e. themes).
- Added support for `themesettings` and `statiq` YAML (`.yml` and `.yaml`) and XML (`.xml`) configuration files in themes.
